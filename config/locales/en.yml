  # about us page
  aboutp1: The Hispanic Heritage Project began in 1992 as part of the Pioneer Room Friends of the Escondido Public Library to raise funds for purchasing additional books on the Spanish Colonial Period that is currently housed in the Pioneer Room. We organized high school and adult Hispanic community members in several fund raising projects. One of our projects was selling tacos at Escondido's First Night, the city's New Year celebration. In addition we picked and sold oranges in front of the public library donated from the grove owned by an Hispanic community member. Later,the city of Escondido noticing our activities offered us an orange and avocado grove to manage as a fund raiser.

  aboutp2: It was during this time that we became aware that an indexing project of the Hidalgo de Parral municipal archive had stopped because of lack of funds. We were able with the proceeds from our avocado and orange grove to provide them funds to complete the guide to the archive. In the process we became aware of other needs in the archive and continued for several years to provide donated equipment and funds for research assistants working in the archive.

  aboutp3: As we worked on our projects other needs came to our attention. The parish of San Bartolome in Valle de Allende did not have a copy machine making it difficult for researchers to obtain copies of documents. We donated a copy machine to the parish. The archive in the Parral Diocese was vandalized and we provided the manpower to put the archive back into order. We have provided donated equipment to the diocese in Durango and the Institute of Historical Investigations at the University of Juarez in Durango. We also provided a donation for the publication of the guide to the collection at the Historical Archive of Colima.

  aboutp4: We continue to serve as our resources allow us and presently we have received several requests to digitize other historical archives in Mexico.
