  # about us page
  aboutp1: The Hispanic Heritage Project began in 1992 as part of the Pioneer Room Friends of the Escondido Public Library to raise funds for purchasing additional books on the Spanish Colonial Period that is currently housed in the Pioneer Room. We organized high school and adult Hispanic community members in several fund raising projects. One of our projects was selling tacos at Escondido's First Night, the city's New Year celebration. In addition we picked and sold oranges in front of the public library donated from the grove owned by an Hispanic community member. Later,the city of Escondido noticing our activities offered us an orange and avocado grove to manage as a fund raiser.

  aboutp2: It was during this time that we became aware that an indexing project of the Hidalgo de Parral municipal archive had stopped because of lack of funds. We were able with the proceeds from our avocado and orange grove to provide them funds to complete the guide to the archive. In the process we became aware of other needs in the archive and continued for several years to provide donated equipment and funds for research assistants working in the archive.

  aboutp3: As we worked on our projects other needs came to our attention. The parish of San Bartolome in Valle de Allende did not have a copy machine making it difficult for researchers to obtain copies of documents. We donated a copy machine to the parish. The archive in the Parral Diocese was vandalized and we provided the manpower to put the archive back into order. We have provided donated equipment to the diocese in Durango and the Institute of Historical Investigations at the University of Juarez in Durango. We also provided a donation for the publication of the guide to the collection at the Historical Archive of Colima.

  aboutp4: We continue to serve as our resources allow us and presently we have received several requests to digitize other historical archives in Mexico.

  projectsp1: At the end of last October 2008 we received a request from the Parral Municipal archive (the largest colonial archive in Northern Mexico) to preserve their collection in a digital format. Then three local parishes, San Bartolome, Villa Coronado and Santa Barbara also requested assistance in digitizing their ecclesiastical archives. The San Bartolome parish has a document written in 1575. Later we became aware of the need to assist three small municipal archives in the state of Guanajuato. Previously the Documentary Relations of the Southwest (DRSW) of the Arizona State Museum at the University of Arizona had requested our assistance in obtaining permission to digitize a portion of the Sonora State Archive in Hermosillo, Mexico.

  projectsp2: We accepted the call to help. Our next move was to approach the Mexican foundation, Apoyo al desarrollo de archivos y bibliotecas de Mexico, A.C. (ADABI) to join us in the project. They agreed and will assume the responsibility of organizing the materials prior to us digitizing the records. This archive has extensive important information relating to the native American history of the Southwestern United States. Up to the present time, it has been difficult for university student researchers to gain access to this archive. Our efforts in this new partnership should open the doors to those students for all future researching activities. Once digitized, the records of these projects will be made available through the internet at no cost to all who desire knowledge of this early Spanish Colonial American history.
